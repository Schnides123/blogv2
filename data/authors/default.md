Alex Schneider is a New York raised, Boston based software engineer at NetNumber. His work ranges from backend routing and signalling software for telecom networks, to web sites and full-stack applications.

Outside of work, Alex spends his free time on everything from photography to skiing, music production, and the occasional half-baked side-project. He's a true multihyphenate, but without the things like talent, clout, or outrageous accomplishments which would normally accompany such a description.
